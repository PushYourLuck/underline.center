## 大家好 (dàjiā hǎo), Bangalore Mahjong Clinic players!


We are a cozy community space in Indiranagar (right next door to Lavonne). We are on weekdays (Mon-Fri), between 9am and 5pm for you to come play mahjong. We have several 3ft x 3ft tables that work great for Mahjong.

For folks from Bangalore Mahjong Clinic, we're happy to offer our space at rate of Rs. 150/person/hour. You can contact me via WhatsApp ( [+919790532594](tel:+919790532594)) if you'd like to make a reservation. No pre-payment necessarily.



* A quiet, (mostly) distraction free environment with some light background music
* Your own dedicated table to sit at
* Fast internet, good lighting, air conditioning, and power backup. We also have a water dispenser and two attached gender-neutral bathrooms.
* A dining area where you can eat food you’ve packed from home or ordered in through Swiggy/Zomato. We have a microwave as well. (You’ll also have access to Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters which is right below us). Note: We **don't allow food and drinks in the main space**.

### FAQs

**Do you have a Mahjong set?**
Unfortunately we don't have any Mahjong sets at our space. You will need to bring your own. We do have a few black tablemats that can be used to protect the tiles.


**Can I just walk-in?**

Please drop a message or call Karthik at [+919790532594](tel:+919790532594) before coming. **We might not open at 9am unless there is someone coming so please call!**.

**Will there be other people in the space?**

On Tuesdays we have a few members from our community (maybe 6-7 people) who use the space as a quiet co-working space. That is the only day you'll likely have to share the space with others.
