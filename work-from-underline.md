## Work from Underline Center

Are you tired of working out of the same place every day? Is there an overdue to-do list looming over your head? Would a change of scenery help you focus and get work done? You can work out of our space from 10am-5pm on weekdays!

We have a suggested price of Rs. 399/day, but you can pay-what-you-want depending on your judgement. You **don't need to pay in advance**, so please come use the space first. We'll share a link to a webpage where you can make a payment. We follow an honor system and we won't ask anyone if they've paid or not.

You can RSVP buy clicking on the floating button on the bottom right corner of this page.


### What kind of work is this for?

We think you can make the best of this space if you focus on work you don't usually do elsewhere. A different environment might lead to a different headspace and focus. While there is obviously day-job related work, consider using us as an excuse to get to those things you don't usually take time to do.

* **Writing and research** - you can use this time to journal or do some deep reading.
* **Studying** - If you are prepping for an exam, or upcoming assignment, you can use this time to focus and study
* **Planning** - Do some meta-work and make to-do lists and plan out the rest of the week, or that upcoming vacation
* **Chores** - From sorting through WhatsApp/email unreads, to ordering groceries - we all have a bunch of 5-minute tasks we never get around to doing
* **Creative work** - We hope the cozy and quiet environment is also great for drawing, writing, and other creative works.

### What to expect

* A quiet, (mostly) distraction free environment with some light background music.
* Your own dedicated table to sit at.
* Fast internet, plug points, air conditioning, a printer, and power backup.
* A dining area where you can eat food you've packed or ordered in through Swiggy/Zomato. (You'll also have access to Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters which is right below us).

### FAQs

**Can I just walk-in?**

You can RSVP up until 10am on the same day, if you decide to come after that, please drop a message or call Karthik at [+919790532594](tel:+919790532594) before coming. **We might not open at 10am unless there is someone coming so please call!**.

**Can I take calls or do in-person meetings?**

We expect people to be mindful and keep the shared space quiet, as that allows people to focus. We have a enclosed terrace/dining area where you are can take calls and meetings. There is also the coffee shop downstairs.

**Can I use any of the games/puzzles/etc that are on the shelf?**

Unfortunately our puzzles and games are owned by different organizers and their communities, so we can't allow access to them outside of their specific events.

**Can I bulk-book or RSVP for multiple days?**

Not currently. Please RSVP individually for each day you are planning to come.

**How much in advance can I RSVP?**

You can RSVP upto to 14 days in advance.

**Why are some days unavailable while RSVPing?**

We might have private bookings or housekeeping/maintainence days, so they will be unavailable on the calendar.
