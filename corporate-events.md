## Team building activities that actually work

We've been hosting community events for over 8 years, and have inadvertently become pretty good at designing activities that are fun to participate in but are secretly about socialising and getting to know other people. These span **board games, puzzles, quizzes, and more**.

We're all familiar with the cookie-cutter team dinners and yearly offsites, so why don't you consider doing something different and bringing your team for ~2-3 hour event with us in Indiranagar, Bangalore. We can work with teams between 10 and 40 people.

### Each group is going be different

If you are a tight knit team that works out of the office every day, perhaps you'd be more interested in something that's collaborative or competitive that encourages your team to build camaraderie and have something to talk about when they are back at the office.

For teams that are mostly work-from-home (or relatively new), we can design something that's more around breaking the ice and getting to know the other people.

If this is something specifically for the leadership/management teams, we'd suggest something that's around collaborative problem solving, which helps surface people's strengths and weaknesses in communication, problem solving, etc.

## What you can expect

* 2-3 hour activity (usually around board games and puzzles) for teams of 10 to 40 people.
* Two (or three) facilitors to conduct the event, assist participants, etc
* Access to a dining area for snacks/tea/coffee (catered at cost)

## Pricing and availability 

Pricing is a combination of number of people, how long the activity is, and how much preparation we'll need to do in advance. You can expect this to be between **Rs. 30,000** and **Rs. 70,000**. We also can work out a discounted rate for teams that want to commit to doing a few a year (eg. once a quarter) or are flexible with timings.

We are available to host these activities on **weekdays between 2pm and 6pm**. Companies usually opt for 4-6pm, and then plan for dinner/drinks at a restaurant that's nearby (we are walking distance from several establishments).
